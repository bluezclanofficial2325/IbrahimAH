**By November 8th, 2023 i was supposed to know how to use a VM, Ubuntu, PowerShell:**

- **Create and verify the correct folder structure in Windows for installing the VM.**
    - Make sure you have enough space for installing the VM
    - install your liking of a VM
- Correctly (and cleanly) install Ubuntu without any of the system updates.
    - use this link to make a clean install of the base ubuntu:[**https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop](https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop)**
    - use your desired hard drive space that you’ve picked and put it into there.
    - 
- Download, and install Powershell 7.x.x inside Ubuntu.
    - go to the application store and search up powershell then, install powershell.
- Use the "cd", "dir", "ls" and "Tab(key)" to quickly navigate folders and find files.
- Make new Folders and Files
- Move existing Folders and Files
- Edit and names of Folders and Files
- Delete Folders and Files
- Use "nano" to edit the contents of files
- Shutdown/power off Ubuntu from inside the VM

**Networking Basics In Cybersecturity:**

- Ifconfig

    - IP short for Internet Protocol is a numerical label such as 192.0.2.1 that is connected to a computer network that uses the internet protocol for communication.
- Traceroute
    - A traceroute provides a map of how data on the internet travels from its source to its destination.
- Tracepath
    - A "trace path" is a networking tool used to identify the route data packets take from their source to destination across a network, revealing the hops and transit delays along the path, helpful for diagnosing network issues.
- Ping
    - "Ping" is a network diagnostic tool that measures the round-trip time for messages sent between a computer and a network host, used to check the availability and response time of the host.
- Netstat
    - "Netstat" is a network utility tool that displays network connections, routing tables, and a number of network interface statistics, useful for diagnosing network issues.

    - Nslookup is a command-line tool used for querying the Domain Name System (DNS) to find out IP addresses associated with a domain name or vice versa. It's commonly used in network troubleshooting and for DNS-related queries.
- Route
    - A route in networking is a path that network traffic takes between devices or across networks. It's used to direct data packets from a source to a destination through intermediate network nodes and links.
- Host
    - In computing, a host refers to a computer or other device connected to a network that provides data, services, or resources to other devices or clients on the network.
- ARP
    - ARP, or Address Resolution Protocol, is a network protocol used to find the hardware (MAC) address of a device associated with a specific IP address on a local network segment.
- IWconfig
    - IWconfig is a command-line tool in Unix-like operating systems used to configure wireless network interfaces. It provides options to set or display wireless settings such as SSID, frequency, and encryption keys.
- Hostname

- Curl Or Wget
    - curl and wget are command-line tools for data transfer. curl supports multiple protocols and scripting, while wget specializes in downloading files, often from web servers.
- MTR
    - MTR (My Traceroute) is a network diagnostic tool that combines the functionalities of the 'traceroute' and 'ping' programs. It provides continuous network routing and performance analysis data.
- WHOIS
    - whois is a query and response protocol used for querying databases that store registered users or assignees of an Internet resource, such as a domain name or an IP address block, to obtain information about the registrant.
- IfPlugStatus
    - ifplugstatus is a tool that checks the status of Ethernet network interfaces, showing whether a cable is plugged in and if the interface is active.
- Iftop
    - iftop is a command-line tool that displays bandwidth usage on a network interface in real-time. It shows a list of network connections and their data transfer rates.
- Tcpdump
    - Tcpdump is a powerful command-line packet analyzer used for network troubleshooting and analysis. It captures and displays the content of packets transmitted or received over a network to which the computer is connected.
- IP Address (IPV4)
    - An IP address is a unique numerical label assigned to each device on a network to identify and locate it.
- Subnet Masks
    - A subnet mask is a number that divides an IP address into network and host parts, organizing networks within a larger network.
- Gateway
    - A gateway is the input or output of the connection to the network
- DNS (Domain Name System)
    - DNS (Domain Name System) converts domain names into IP addresses, functioning as the internet's phonebook.
- What is a Network Switch?
    - A network switch is a hardware device that connects devices within a local network, directing data to its intended destination within that network. It's essential for managing network traffic efficiently.
- What is a Network router?
    - A network router is a device that forwards data packets between computer networks, directing internet traffic. It connects different networks together, like your home network to the internet.
- What are "access points?”
    - Access points are devices that create a wireless local area network, usually in an office or large building. They connect to a wired router, switch, or hub via an Ethernet cable, and project a Wi-Fi signal to a designated area.
- MAC Address
    - A MAC address is a unique identifier for network devices, used for communication on physical networks like Ethernet and Wi-Fi.
- What are “Ports” in network addressing
    - Ports in networking are virtual endpoints identified by numbers, used to route data to specific services or applications on a device.
- what are these types of networks? (WAN, LAN, PAN, MAN and VPN)
    - WAN (Wide Area Network): A network covering large geographical areas, connecting smaller networks like LANs, often spanning cities or countries.
    - LAN (Local Area Network): A network covering a small geographic area, like a home, office, or building, used for connecting computers and devices within this limited area.
    - PAN (Personal Area Network): A network for personal devices typically within a range of 10 meters, like Bluetooth or wireless keyboards and mice.
    - MAN (Metropolitan Area Network): A network that covers a larger geographic area than a LAN but smaller than a WAN, typically spanning a city or a campus.
    - VPN (Virtual Private Network): A service that creates a secure, encrypted connection over a less secure network, like the internet, providing privacy and security.

### Spot check study stuff:

- pwd — Prints the directory you’re working in.
- ls — Lists the items (files/folders) in your current location.
    - Options:
        - File System Navigation
            - ls -l — Shows a detailed list of files.
            - ls -a — Reveals hidden files.
- cd — Allows you to change directories.
    - Examples:
        - cd Documents — Navigates to an exact directory path.
        - cd Documents — Moves into a folder relative to your current one.
        - cd .. — Takes you one level up in the directory structure.
        - cd ~ — Brings you directly to your home folder.
    - Quick Tip:
        - You can check command manuals with man [command].
        - For more info on commands like ls, search terms like "Linux ls command guide," or ask me if you’re uncertain.

1. Basic File and Folder Operations (CRUD)

Create:

- touch newfile.txt — Makes a new, empty file.
- mkdir newfolder — Creates a new directory (folder).

Read:

- cat newfile.txt — Displays the file’s contents in the terminal.
- less newfile.txt — Opens the file and lets you scroll through the contents.

Update:

- nano newfile.txt — Opens the file for editing in the Nano text editor.
- echo "Some text" >> newfile.txt — Adds new text to the end of the file.

Delete:

- rm newfile.txt — Deletes the file.
- rmdir newfolder — Deletes an empty directory.
- rm -r newfolder — Recursively deletes the directory and its contents.
    - extra stuff help:
        - Be cautious when using rm as it permanently deletes files.
        - If unsure, search for terms like "Safe file deletion in Linux" for advice.

1. File Permissions and chmod

Understanding Permissions:

- Use ls -l to see the permissions on files.
- File permissions are shown as rwxrwxrwx, divided for the User, Group, and Others.
    - Each letter means:
        - r — Read (4)
        - w — Write (2)
        - x — Execute (1)

Changing Permissions:

- Symbolic way:
    - chmod u+x filename — Gives the user execute permission.
    - chmod g-w filename — Removes write permission from the group.

Tippers:

- Experiment with permissions on practice files to understand how they work.
- Online resources, like "chmod in Linux explained," can provide more examples.

1. Using sudo for Administrative Tasks

Basic Usage:

- sudo [command] — Runs a command as an administrator (superuser).
    - Example: sudo apt update — Updates the list of available software packages.
    - Warning:
        - Be careful when running sudo commands, as they can modify the system.
        - If unsure, Google "how to safely use sudo in Linux" for further reading or ask for clarification.
